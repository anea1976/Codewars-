In this simple exercise, you will create a program that will take two lists of integers, a and b. Each list will consist of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids a and b. You must find the difference of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.

For example, if the parameters passed are ([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1]), the volume of a is 12 and the volume of b is 20. Therefore, the function should return 8.

Your function will be tested with pre-made examples as well as random ones.

Solution 1:
function findDifference(a, b) {
  let cub1 = a.reduce((acc,c) => acc * c)
  let cub2 = b.reduce((acc,c) => acc * c)
  return cub2>cub1? cub2-cub1:cub1-cub2;
}
Solution 2:
function find_difference(a, b) {
  return Math.abs(a.reduce((previous, current) => previous * current) - b.reduce((previous, current) => previous * current));
}
