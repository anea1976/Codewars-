// INSTRUCTIONS:
// Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

// [Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]

// SOLUTION
function greet(name){
    return `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`
  }

  //Arrow function solution:
  const greet=n=>`Hello, ${n} how are you doing today?`;
