// CODEWARS 8KYU NOT SO BLACK BOX 

// INSTRUCITONS;

// The kata has been preloaded with a function called blackBox. Figure out what the function does.

// You may need to think laterally!

//SOLUTION:
function blackBox(){
    return "It's clamped shut!"
  };

  //Need to call JSopenSesame for 'attempt' to work, no idea what that is.
  
  JSopenSesame()


  //change test from check() to blackbox() as well

  Test.expect(blackBox(), "It's clamped shut!");
