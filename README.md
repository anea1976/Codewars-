# About Codewars 

Codewars is a programming platform that helps users train and hone their coding skills by solving coding challenges known as 'katas'.


## What I love about being a CodeWarrior

* I love puzzles: the katas allow me to have fun while improving my programming skills.
* The gamified aspect: Approaching the challenges with a gaming mindset, I found that being motivated to earn points helped me to keep going after many failed attempts, 
which has helped me develop resilience and become less scared of failure.
* Learning from others: I always look at other codewarriors' solutions and never cease to be amazed at the variety of possible solutions for even the simplest programming problem.
* Tangible progress: I know this is an obvious one  but I really love that the more I practise, the better and faster I get at solving challenges. 
This is one of the things that comfort me on down days when I'm trying to learn hard programing concepts and my brain just seems unable to make any sense of it: I remind myself of the katas I have crushed and keep going until the tough subject joins my list of solved challenges. It works every single timeðŸ˜Š
